## Open Beta. 

Minors update :

1. added phd(s) to team mate board.

2. corrected some error...

3. added **alpha** [technical doc website](https://labsim.github.io/technical-doc/) + binding but it remains under heavy construction. *feedbacks are welcome.*

4. added **alpha** [personnal profile exemple](https://nkinani.github.io/profile/) on team board based on *[Academic Theme for HUGO](https://gcushen.github.io/hugo-academic-demo/)*. This second link is far more complete. *feedbacks are welcome.*

Next update :

1. finish & polish team mate board.

2. add content to LABSIM technical documentation website.

3. if personal profile convinced you & fit your needs, then i will write down a "HOW TO" procedure.

Cheers.
